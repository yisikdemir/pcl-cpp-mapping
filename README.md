### What is Point Cloud

A point cloud is a collection of points in 3D space that represent the external surface or features of an object or environment. These points are typically generated by laser scanners, photogrammetry, or other methods of 3D scanning. Each point in the point cloud represents a coordinate in 3D space, and may also contain additional information such as color, reflectivity, or intensity.

Point clouds are often used in fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and virtual reality, as well as in various engineering applications such as architectural design, construction, and surveying. They can be processed and analyzed using specialized software to extract useful information, such as object dimensions, surface curvature, or other features of interest.

### About This Repository
